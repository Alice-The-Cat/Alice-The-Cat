I've been following a tutorial on opengl es 2.0

I'm stumped at the heightmap part
The heightmap doesn't seem to be showing up as intended
Instead of a terrain with varying height, it displays a weird triangle shape
I also disabled drawing the skybox because it crashes when i draw it with the heightmap (Probably due to memory problems)

If you're willing to look into it, it would be much appreciated
